             are necessary for effective design of future planned solar
             energy systems operating on the surface of Mars. In this paper
             we present a procedure and solar radiation related data from
             which the diurnally, hourly and daily variation of the global,
             direct beam and diffuse insolation on Mars are calculated. The
             radiation data are based on measured optical depth of the
             Martian atmosphere derived from images taken of the sun with a
             special diode on the Viking cameras; and computation based on
             multiple wavelength and multiple scattering of the solar
             radiation.",

  abstract = "The Martian surface is constantly exposed to a high dose of
              cosmic radiation consisting of highly energetic particles and
              multiple types of ionizing radiation. The dose can increase
              temporarily by a factor of 50 through the occurrence of highly
              energetic solar flares. This may affect crop growth in
              greenhouses on the Martian surface possibly making settlement of
              humans more complicated. Shielding crops from radiation might be
              done at the expense of lighting efficiency. However, the most
              energy-efficient cultivation may be achieved through the use of
              natural daylight with the addition of LED lights. The goal of our
              research was to investigate whether Martian radiation, both the
              constant and the solar flares events, affects plant growth of two
              crop species, rye and garden cress. The levels of radiation
              received on the surface of Mars, simulated with an equivalent
              dose of 60Co $\gamma$-photons, had a significant negative effect
              on the growth of the two crop species. Although germination
              percentages were not affected by radiation, biomass growth was
              significantly decreased by 32\% for cress and 48\% for rye during
              the first 4 weeks after germination. Part of the biomass
              differences may be due to differences in temperature between
              radiation and control treatment, however it cannot explain the
              whole difference between the treatment and control. Coloring of
              leaves, necrosis and brown parts, was observed as well. Temporary
              increases in ionizing radiation dose at different development
              stages of the plants did not significantly influence the final
              dry weight of the crops.",

                 ongoing plans for sending the first manned missions to Mars in
                 the near future. In addition to generating oxygen, fixing
                 carbon, and recycling waste and water, plants could play a
                 critical role in producing food and biomass feedstock for the
                 microbial manufacture of materials, chemicals, and medicines
                 in long-term interplanetary outposts. However, because life on
                 Earth evolved under the conditions of the terrestrial
                 biosphere, plants will not perform optimally in different
                 planetary habitats. The construction or transportation of
                 plant growth facilities and the availability of resources,
                 such as sunlight and liquid water, may also be limiting
                 factors, and would thus impose additional challenges to
                 efficient farming in an extraterrestrial destination. Using
                 the framework of the forthcoming human missions to Mars, here
                 we discuss a series of bioengineering endeavors that will
                 enable us to take full advantage of plants in the context of a
                 Martian greenhouse. We also propose a roadmap for research on
                 adapting life to Mars and outline our opinion that synthetic
                 biology efforts towards this goal will contribute to solving
                 some of the main agricultural and industrial challenges here
                 on Earth.",
