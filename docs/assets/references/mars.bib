  abstract = "The Martian surface is constantly exposed to a high dose of
              cosmic radiation consisting of highly energetic particles and
              multiple types of ionizing radiation. The dose can increase
              temporarily by a factor of 50 through the occurrence of highly
              energetic solar flares. This may affect crop growth in
              greenhouses on the Martian surface possibly making settlement of
              humans more complicated. Shielding crops from radiation might be
              done at the expense of lighting efficiency. However, the most
              energy-efficient cultivation may be achieved through the use of
              natural daylight with the addition of LED lights. The goal of our
              research was to investigate whether Martian radiation, both the
              constant and the solar flares events, affects plant growth of two
              crop species, rye and garden cress. The levels of radiation
              received on the surface of Mars, simulated with an equivalent
              dose of 60Co $\gamma$-photons, had a significant negative effect
              on the growth of the two crop species. Although germination
              percentages were not affected by radiation, biomass growth was
              significantly decreased by 32\% for cress and 48\% for rye during
              the first 4 weeks after germination. Part of the biomass
              differences may be due to differences in temperature between
              radiation and control treatment, however it cannot explain the
              whole difference between the treatment and control. Coloring of
              leaves, necrosis and brown parts, was observed as well. Temporary
              increases in ionizing radiation dose at different development
              stages of the plants did not significantly influence the final
              dry weight of the crops.",

              manufacturing and autonomy. These technologies combined with the

              reduce cost for human colonization of Mars. Various system-level

              water, minerals, and other materials on Mars that reshape our
              thinking about the value and capabilities of Mars ISRU; 2) to
              summarize the previous literature on Mars ISRU processes,

              technologies and approaches that can lead to safe and affordable
              human missions to Mars; and 4) to suggest an implementation
              strategy whereby the ISRU elements are phased into the mission

                 replicate (per the COSPAR Planetary Protection Policy). This
                 review and update was conducted by an international team
                 (SR-SAG2) drawn from both the biological science and Mars
                 exploration communities, focused on understanding when and
                 where Special Regions could occur. The study applied recently
                 available data about martian environments and about
                 terrestrial organisms, building on a previous analysis of Mars
                 Special Regions (2006) undertaken by a similar team. Since
                 then, a new body of highly relevant information has been
                 generated from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (launched in
                 2005) and Phoenix (2007) and data from Mars Express and the
                 twin Mars Exploration Rovers (all 2003). Results have also
                 been gleaned from the Mars Science Laboratory (launched in
                 2011). In addition to Mars data, there is a considerable body
                 of new data regarding the known environmental limits to life
                 on Earth-including the potential for terrestrial microbial
                 life to survive and replicate under martian environmental
                 conditions. The SR-SAG2 analysis has included an examination
                 of new Mars models relevant to natural environmental variation
                 in water activity and temperature; a review and
                 reconsideration of the current parameters used to define
                 Special Regions; and updated maps and descriptions of the
                 martian environments recommended for treatment as
                 ``Uncertain'' or ``Special'' as natural features or those
                 potentially formed by the influence of future landed

                 capabilities of terrestrial organisms and the existence of
                 possibly habitable martian environments have led to a new
                 appreciation of where Mars Special Regions may be identified
                 and protected. The SR-SAG also considered the impact of
